          <p>
            Hello my name is Bianey Miranda Carapia. I participated in the Maydm program. We learned about HTML, CSS, and Java script we also learned way more things but those are the main things we leanred and used. Maydm is fun and interasting because you get to learn about coding and technology. My favorite language to leaarn is CSS becasue it makes the page pretty.
